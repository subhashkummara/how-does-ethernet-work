🚀 START RIGHT NOW - 5 Simple Steps
STEP 1: Copy & Paste This (2 minutes)
Open ChatGPT/Claude and paste:

You are an expert networking tutor.

I'm starting to learn Ethernet from scratch. My goal is to understand how Ethernet works at hardware and software level.

Give me:
1. A 5-minute "Ethernet in a nutshell" explanation using simple analogies
2. The 3 most important concepts I must understand first
3. One simple diagram/visual description of how data travels through Ethernet

Make it engaging and assume I know nothing.


STEP 2: Read & Ask Questions (10 minutes)
Read the response
If confused, reply: "Explain [confused part] simpler"
If curious, reply: "Give me a real-world example of [topic]"
STEP 3: Deep Dive Into First Topic (20 minutes)
Copy this next:

You are a networking professor.

Topic: MAC Addresses and Ethernet Frames

Explain:
1. What is a MAC address? (use analogies)
2. What is an Ethernet frame structure?
3. Show me a step-by-step example of Device A sending data to Device B

Keep it simple and visual.


STEP 4: Test Yourself (10 minutes)
After learning, paste:

You just taught me about MAC addresses and Ethernet frames.

Now:
1. Ask me 3 questions to test my understanding
2. Wait for my answers
3. Give me feedback

Don't give answers yet - let me try first.


STEP 5: Tomorrow's Topic (Next Day)
Start with:

You are an embedded systems engineer.

Topic: Ethernet Controller (MAC) vs Transceiver (PHY)

Explain:
1. What each does
2. How they work together
3. Use a car analogy to make it clear

Include a simple flow diagram description.
